		<p>Internet. Everything is there. You can get any information you need, any picture you like. Totally for free. So WHY A HELL is it possible, that "Playboy", "Forbes", "Esquire" keep earning millions of dollars per year just for selling the "outdated paper magazines"? "New York Times", "Guardian", "Financial Times" are still the most influential sources of information. People all over the world spend their money, because they want to SMELL, READ, TOUCH and HEAR the rustling of the newly printed pages.</p>

		<p>There is one place, where the secret is known. The location is: the biggest country of Europe, the largest university of the country. The city, which never sleeps, the one, where you can find absolutely everything possible to imagine and even what is impossible to imagine;) Bright and mottled like a glossy magazine cover; rich with its history, so that thick folio can hardly fit it. Just like the "Times" edition, this city lives at the furious pace!</p>

		<p>Feel excited? Hardly scared by the fact, that all those creative publishers are a bit "not of this world"? Ready for the most outstanding experience ever? Wanna quench your thirst for knowledge?</p>

		<p>If yes, Kiev is the place for you to spend the HOTTEST summer of your life and to discover all the secrets of the mysterious PUBlishing industry - from the zero point, when the idea is born and until the final moment, when the last drop of paint dries ;)</p>
